Oracle Data Dictionary Concept
-------------------------------

--make sure that the pluggable database is open
alter pluggable database ORCLPDB open;

--this will show all the tables in the CDB and PDBS
select owner,table_name,con_id from cdb_tables
order by 1,2;

col owner format a30;
col table_name format a30;

alter pluggable database ORCLPDB close;

select owner,table_name,con_id from cdb_tables
order by 1,2;

alter pluggable database ORCLPDB open;

select owner,table_name,con_id from cdb_tables
order by 1,2;


--count of tables per container
SELECT con_id, COUNT(table_name)
FROM cdb_tables
GROUP BY con_id;


SELECT  COUNT(table_name)
FROM DBA_tables;

ALTER session set container=ORCLPDB;

show con_name;

SELECT  COUNT(table_name)
FROM DBA_tables;

alter session set container=cdb$root;

show con_name;

SELECT  COUNT(table_name)
FROM DBA_tables;

==================================================================

Common users vs local users
-----------------------------

make sure that the pluggable database open:
select con_id, name, open_mode from v$pdbs;

if the orclpdb is mounted, then do this:
alter pluggable database orclpdb open;

show con_name;

--make sure that all pluggable is opened
select con_id,name,open_mode from v$pdbs

alter pluggable database all open;

select username,common,con_id from cdb_users
order by username;

col username format a30;

select distinct(username) from cdb_users
where common='YES'


select username,common,con_id from cdb_users
where common='NO'
order by username;

SHOW PARAMETER common_user_prefix;

CREATE USER t1 IDentified by t1;

CREATE USER C##t1 IDentified by welcome;

select distinct(username) from cdb_users
where common='YES';

alter session set container=orclpdb;

show con_name;

create user khaled identified by khaled;

select username,common,con_id from cdb_users
where common='NO'
order by username;

===============================================================================

Understanding Dynamic Performance Views
-------------------------------------------

show con_name;

alter pluggable database orclpdb open;

alter session set container=orclpdb;

show con_name;

select 
oracle_username
os_user_name,
locked_mode,
object_name,
object_type
from 
v$locked_object a,dba_objects b
where 
a.object_id = b.object_id;

--> no rows selected

select * from hr.employees;
--> table or view does not exist

update hr.employees
set salary=salary+1
where employee_id=100;

select 
oracle_username
os_user_name,
locked_mode,
object_name,
object_type
from 
v$locked_object a,dba_objects b
where 
a.object_id = b.object_id

rollback;

select 
oracle_username
os_user_name,
locked_mode,
object_name,
object_type
from 
v$locked_object a,dba_objects b
where 
a.object_id = b.object_id

=====================================================================

cdb_ & dba_ when you are inside a pluggable database
--------------------------------------------------------

show con_name;

alter session set container=CDB$ROOT;

select count(1) from cdb_tables;

Query the Data Files
------------------------

-- query the data files
/*

( Tables, Rows, indexes ,procedures, viewsâ€¦) 
If you lose Datafiles, you lose your database.
*/

from cdb_data_files;

Open Files, show the directory location:
/u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL/orclpdb/

Files - Other Locations - Computer then u01

--same query but using dba, but here we dont have  con_id

select file_name,file_id,tablespace_name

==============================================================

Query the Temps Files
---------------------

-- query the temps files
/*
A tempfile is a file that is part of an Oracle database. 
Tempfiles are used with TEMPORARY TABLESPACES

Temporary tablespaces are used for special operations, particularly for sorting data results on disk and for 
hash joins in SQL. For SQL with millions of rows returned, the sort operation is too large for the RAM 
area and must occur on disk.  
The temporary tablespace is where this takes place
